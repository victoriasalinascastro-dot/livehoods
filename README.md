# Methodological structure and weights of livelihood, mediating factors, and environmental resource indicators
### 
This repository compiles the tables and weightings that underpin the construction of the indicators for Livelihoods, Mediating Factors, and the use of Environmental Resources. Its purpose is to provide an open and transparent methodological foundation for researchers, lecturers, and students interested in understanding how the indicators used in the analyses of the article *“Household life-cycles of Amazonian indigenous populations, changing livelihoods and effects on the environment: evidence from a longitudinal study in Ecuador”* were developed, as well as for future related research.

The objective is not to present empirical results, but to document the conceptual process and methodological decisions that allowed the operationalization of the indicators —their definition, structure, and relative weighting— based on household and community panel data (2001 and 2012).

This material complements the scientific publication by providing a reference repository where the full weighting tables (Tables 2 and 3 of the article) and the variables that make up the different components of the analytical model can be consulted.

## Dimensions and weights of the livelihoods, environmental resources, and mediating factors model

The following tables present the overall structure of the indicators that make up the Livelihoods, Environmental Resources, and Mediating Factors model.

Tables 1, 2, and 3 provide a summarized view of each set of dimensions, indicating the number of variables included and the total weight assigned to each within the model.

Subsequently, the complete tables present the detailed composition of each dimension —variables, indicators, and weights— following the same order: first Livelihoods, then Environmental Resources, and finally Mediating Factors.

### Table 1– Summary of dimensions and weights for livelihoods 

| Variable | Weight |

| 1. Financial capital (177 variables) | 51 |
| 2. Natural capital (13 variables) | 20 |
| 3. Human capital (12 variables) | 21 |
| 4. Social capital (5 variables) | 8 |

### Table 2– Summary of dimensions and weights for environmental resources

| Variable | Weight |

| 2. Collection of forest products (8 variables) | 10 |
| 3. Hunting (13 variables) | 20 |
| 4. Fishing (15 variables) | 20 |

### Table 3. Summary of dimensions and weights for mediating factors

| Variables | Weight |
|:-----------|-------:|
| **Mediating factors** | **100** |
| 1. Services available in the community (9 variables) | 4.5 |
